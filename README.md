An automated bot for the browser-based game "Plemiona" (Tribal Wars) that manages scavenging missions to gather resources without player intervention.

## üåü Features

- **Automated Authentication**: Login via cookies or credentials
- **Intelligent Scheduling**: Waits for ongoing missions to complete
- **Optimal Resource Gathering**: Distributes troops efficiently across scavenging levels
- **Easy Control**: API endpoints to start/stop the bot and manage settings
- **Persistence**: Stores cookies and settings for continuous operation
- **Flexible Operation**: Run in headless mode or with visible browser

## üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MySQL (v5.7 or higher)
- npm or yarn

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://your-repository-url/plemiona-bot.git
   cd plemiona-bot
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file with the following configuration:

   ```
   DATABASE_HOST=localhost
   DATABASE_PORT=3306
   DATABASE_NAME=plemiona_bot
   BACKEND_PORT=3000

   # Plemiona Game Credentials
   PLEMIONA_USERNAME=your_game_username
   PLEMIONA_PASSWORD=your_game_password
   PLEMIONA_TARGET_WORLD=≈öwiat XX
   ```

4. Run database migrations:

   ```bash
   npm run migration:run
   ```

5. Start the application:

   ```bash
   # Development mode
   npm run start:dev

   # Production mode
   npm run start:prod
   ```

## üéÆ Usage

### API Endpoints

The API is available at `https://bot-plemiona-api.wojciechfalkowski.pl/` with Swagger documentation at `https://bot-plemiona-api.wojciechfalkowski.pl/api`.

#### Scavenging Operations

- **GET /api/scavenging/run-headless**: Start the bot in background mode
- **GET /api/scavenging/run-visible**: Start the bot with visible browser (debugging)

#### Settings Management

- **GET /api/settings/scavenging/auto**: Check if auto-scavenging is enabled
- **PUT /api/settings/scavenging/auto**: Enable/disable auto-scavenging

  ```json
  {
    "enabled": true
  }
  ```

- **GET /api/settings/plemiona/cookies**: Retrieve saved authentication cookies
- **PUT /api/settings/plemiona/cookies**: Update authentication cookies
  ```json
  {
    "cookies": [
      {
        "name": "pl_auth",
        "value": "your-cookie-value",
        "domain": ".plemiona.pl",
        "path": "/",
        "expires": 1714464392
      },
      {
        "name": "sid",
        "value": "your-session-id",
        "domain": "pl216.plemiona.pl",
        "path": "/",
        "expires": -1
      }
      // Additional cookies...
    ]
  }
  ```

### Configuration

The bot's behavior can be customized by editing configuration files:

#### Game Configuration (src/utils/scavenging.config.ts)

```typescript
export const scavengingSettings = {
  max_resources: 99999,  // Maximum resources to target
  archers: 0,            // Set to 1 if the world has archers
  skip_level_1: 0,       // Set to 1 to skip level 1 if others are available
};

// Unit settings like capacity, untouchable counts, etc.
export const unitSettings = { ... };
```

#### Login Information

Game credentials are stored in environment variables:

```
PLEMIONA_USERNAME=your_game_username
PLEMIONA_PASSWORD=your_game_password
PLEMIONA_TARGET_WORLD=≈öwiat XX
```

These are used as a fallback when cookie authentication fails. For security reasons, it's strongly recommended to use cookies for authentication whenever possible.

## üìù Future Improvements

The following features are planned for future development:

- Support for multiple villages (currently hardcoded to one village ID)
- Web dashboard for monitoring bot status and detailed statistics
- Advanced scheduling options (time-based operation, resource targeting)
- Support for other game activities (farming, recruitment, building)
- Email/Discord notifications for important events or errors
- Enhanced error handling and recovery mechanisms

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- Currently supports only a single village
- Village ID is hardcoded (URL parameter in crawler.service.ts)
- No visual interface for monitoring status
- Limited error recovery for unexpected game changes
- Cookie authentication may break with game updates

## üîí Security Considerations

- **Never commit your .env file** to version control
- Store credentials in environment variables instead of hardcoding them
- For production deployments, consider using secrets management solutions
- The bot stores cookies in the database; ensure database security
- Consider using a dedicated user account for the bot with limited privileges in the game

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Bot fails to login**:

   - Check your cookies or credentials
   - Verify the game hasn't changed its login page structure

2. **Scavenging doesn't start**:

   - Ensure auto-scavenging is enabled via the API
   - Check logs for any specific errors

3. **Database connection errors**:
   - Verify your database credentials and connection settings
   - Ensure migrations have been run

### Logs

The application generates detailed logs during operation. Check these logs for any error messages or unexpected behavior. In production, logs are stored in the application's standard output.
